 **Peeler Overview**: We collected active ransomware samples from more than 60 ransomware families. Each ransomware sample was executed in a VirtualBox and then manually labeled by each family type. We developled our own tool to collect provenance data which will be made available here. We ran each ransomware sample for ten minutes or until all user files were encrypted. It took more than 90 days to run all samples and collect data.
 
 **Malcious Commands dataset**: A comprehensive list of malicious commands used by ransomware from our dataset. The key “text” in the JSON shows set of malicious process/commands. The key “label” key value 1 means its malicious, i.e., in the context of ransomware operations. This data in the file is normalized, which means numbers are replaced with “num”. Full paths are replaced with “PATH”, executable name is replaced with “Executable”, IP addresses are replaced with “IP_ADDRESS”, and process ids are represented as “PID”.
